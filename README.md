Here's a `README.md` you can use for your GitHub repository that guides users through setting up Python 3.10.x, TensorFlow 2.15, and Flask 3.0.3 for running a Python-based API:

# Python API Setup with TensorFlow 2.15 and Flask 3.0.3

This repository provides a basic setup for a Python API using:
- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow 2.15**
- **Flask 3.0.3**

## üîß Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.10 installed on your machine. You can check your current version with:

```bash
python --version
```

If it's not Python 3.10, consider using a version manager like [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or installing Python 3.10 manually from the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow==2.15.0 flask==3.0.3
```

Alternatively, use the `requirements.txt` file if provided:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the API

Assuming you have a file named `app.py` that starts your Flask API:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.



## üì¶ Requirements File (Optional)

You can generate a `requirements.txt` file with:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
flask==3.0.3
tensorflow==2.15.0
```

## üìù Notes

- If using GPU with TensorFlow, make sure you have CUDA and cuDNN installed correctly for TensorFlow 2.15.
- Always activate your virtual environment before running or deploying your API.
